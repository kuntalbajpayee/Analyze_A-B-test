Analyze A/B Test Results
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that we get some practice working with the 
difficulties of these.

For this project, i will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a
new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the 
company's product. 
We will use 
1.Statistics
2.Regression
3.Probability
in order to testify and verify whether we need to change the data set or not
